            <blockquote cite="https://www.biography.com/business-figure/elon-musk">
            <p> <strong> Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971) </strong>is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (<i>which later became PayPal</i>), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, to a division of Compaq Computers.

                Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.
                
                In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.</p>
